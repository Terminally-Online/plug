Do These:
    Shared:
        ☐ Fix hydration error
            Notes: This started when I added <SocketActivity /> -- No idea why it is happening though.
        ☐ Where do users initiate the transfer assets interaction flow
        ☐ Cache balances in the database
            ☐ Refresh prices on a regular basis since it comes from a free api

    Console:
        Small:
            ☐ When you drag a column it halts as the previous state for a second before confirming.
            ☐ Instant socket address resolution.
                Notes: We are not going to mine for an efficient address. Instead, we will take the hash generation method and use it to automatically generate a socket address upon creation.
            ☐ Make resizing more performant.
                Notes: right now it is rerendering everything on a new frame as well as posting into the database.
            ☐ Referal functionality.
            ☐ Settings column.
                ☐ add contact info to database.
            ☐ Show total asset value when viewing tokens.
                Notes: This does not include collectibles.

        Medium:
            ☐ Update navigation links while in console to update the state of the column rather redirect to the app page.
                ☐ Back button in context of the column.
            ☐ Frames in the context of the column instead of the full page.
            ☐ Figure out how to handle the resizing of users going from app → console → app.
            ☐ Create Plug should open create plug flow
                Notes: Opens to action addition menu right away, this is colorful and shows user options right away
            ☐ Level system - start with database schema that enables users to "Level Up" within Plug. 
                Notes: Features like Bounty Board are only available to certain levels, levels might be reached from count of actions completed, etc
            ☐ Earnings column
                Notes: Blocked by functioning executions
                ☐ Bar chart stacked for forks and community runs 
                ☐ Fee claim button
                ☐ Top performers
            ☐ New Plug default privacy settings
            
        Large:
            ☐ Activity
                ☐ Add total execution count to top
                ☐ Chart showing asset value over time  
            ☐ Revoke all    
            
    App:
        ☐ On logged in homepage, when user has no plugs, show 2 curated Plugs and CTA to create a Plug @@chance @started(24-06-27 11:55)
            ☐ Include curated plugs in the homepage
                Notes: The only idea I have up to this point is to have a temporary frame that opens up with all the options
                and a search bar that allows you to filter down through the options. We do not want to use the default
                browser dropdown because they look like ass and we do not want to use popovers in general because
                it is exceptionally bad UX to have elements that cover other information. Unlike a normal app, 
                we cannot just push it to the side because the input is full width (ie: frames) so it would be weird
                regardless of where it is placed.
        ☐ Input validation @chance
        ☐ ETH balances when selecting a chain to execute on @chance
        ☐ Handle 404 and 504 errors for when we retrieve a specific Plug
        ☐ After forking, do not show it in the templates unless the actions have changed @chance
        ☐ When a plug is deleted that you are viewing that is not yours... @chance
            ☐ Fix the bug where it only shows sometimes.
                Notes: There is some edge case where it is not always showing and I don't know what it is.

Drake Tasks:
    ☐ Rounded square logos
        Source and share w/ chance because image uploads from my side don't work.

Bugs:
    ☐ When you plugs are edited that you do not own they show up on your homepage.
    ☐ Choosing a different secondary value in parent dependent action values does not result in the new value being saved. @chance
        Notes: If you choose a noun accessory, and then choose a new one, the old one is still saved. This is presumably
               due to the "new value" checks that I implemented where we are checking if the parent value is the same,
               and if so, we early return resulting in the new child value not being saved..
    ☐ Need to remove the viewed plugs from the users context plug list after they stop viewing a plug.
    ☐ When you direct access a plug, it errors out when the global context has not yet been loaded.
        Notes: I do not remember this bug - 08/01/2024

    ☐ Intent signing and submission

    Notes: Don't know what this should realistically look like. I have departed from what we had in the Figma because
    it was a bit reductive in functionality and showing the calendar only once you click into a time component
    results in the frame being super wobbly as components are hidden and shown.

    Notes: You make these decisions. There are code references for you already. You should have all 
    the technical knowledge needed to make these decisions and update the API/frontend
    to whatever decision you make.
  ✔ Decision: @done(24-06-27 14:24) @project(Drake Tasks)
    In MVP, curated plugs are persistent. 
    They are not hidden when you search/filter by tag.

  ✔ Fix scrolling in big frames @chance @done(24-06-24 23:04) @project(Bugs)
    Notes: A piece of this is because there are multiple frames open at once when there shouldn't be.
    Conclusion: This was the entirety of the issue. Broke them into their own frames with only one
    active at a time and everything resolved itself.

    Conclusion: I just hid it because it is 2024 and who the hell cares about scrollbars.
