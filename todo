☐ Fix plug creation flow everywhere that it is used.
☐ Full management of an anonymous and a demo user.

        ☐ Native balance on optimism shows differently?
            Notes: Not actually sure about this but I think it is showing as 'Ether' instead of 'Ethereum'
            Notes: This is just on Optimism after they migrated everyones dead balances from the bridge. Not sure
                   if this balance is double-stored everywhere or not. Right now though, other places properly handle
                   this but Alchemy has data that incorrect and truncated.

    Console:
        Small:
            ☐ Make resizing more performant.
                Notes: right now it is rerendering everything on a new frame as well as posting into the database.
            ☐ Referal functionality.
            ☐ Show total asset value when viewing tokens.
                Notes: This does not include collectibles.
            ☐ plugs.all is a protectedProcedure, but it should be a publicProcedure so that you can browse without connecting.
            ☐ Make plug cards look better.
            ☐ Re-enable the functionality of the `featureRequest` and `deleted` frames.
              Notes: Just need to decide where to put these and then this will be pretty straightforward.

        Medium:
            ☐ Add a "loading" experience once inside the app to minimize flashing as we are calculating the visual breakpoint with client-side javascript.
            ☐ The plugs pages (discover, mine, and all) temporarily show text before the request has returned a response.
              Notes: We should only show this text when the response has returned no results or it has errored out.

            ☐ Instant socket address resolution.
              Notes: We are not going to mine for an efficient address. Instead, we will take the hash generation method and use it to automatically generate a socket address upon creation.
            ☐ Create Plug should open create plug flow
              Notes: Opens to action addition menu right away, this is colorful and shows user options right away
              Notes: This is complexitiy that isn't needed for MVP. We will come back to this later.
            
        Large:
            ☐ Activity
              ☐ Add total execution count to top
            ☐ Revoke all    
            ☐ Implement complete send functionality to the token page.

        Extra Large:
            ☐ Improve the onboarding / authentication flow. @started(24-08-12 13:32)
            
    App:
        ☐ On logged in homepage, when user has no plugs, show 2 curated Plugs and CTA to create a Plug @@chance @started(24-06-27 11:55)
            ☐ Include curated plugs in the homepage
                Notes: The only idea I have up to this point is to have a temporary frame that opens up with all the options
                and a search bar that allows you to filter down through the options. We do not want to use the default
                browser dropdown because they look like ass and we do not want to use popovers in general because
                it is exceptionally bad UX to have elements that cover other information. Unlike a normal app, 
                we cannot just push it to the side because the input is full width (ie: frames) so it would be weird
                regardless of where it is placed.
        ☐ Input validation @chance
        ☐ ETH balances when selecting a chain to execute on @chance
        ☐ Handle 404 and 504 errors for when we retrieve a specific Plug
        ☐ After forking, do not show it in the templates unless the actions have changed @chance
        ☐ When a plug is deleted that you are viewing that is not yours... @chance
            ☐ Fix the bug where it only shows sometimes.
                Notes: There is some edge case where it is not always showing and I don't know what it is.

Drake Tasks:
    ☐ Rounded square logos
        Source and share w/ chance because image uploads from my side don't work.

Bugs:
    ☐ When you plugs are edited that you do not own they show up on your homepage.
    ☐ Choosing a different secondary value in parent dependent action values does not result in the new value being saved. @chance
        Notes: If you choose a noun accessory, and then choose a new one, the old one is still saved. This is presumably
               due to the "new value" checks that I implemented where we are checking if the parent value is the same,
               and if so, we early return resulting in the new child value not being saved..
    ☐ Need to remove the viewed plugs from the users context plug list after they stop viewing a plug.
    ☐ When you direct access a plug, it errors out when the global context has not yet been loaded.
        Notes: I do not remember this bug - 08/01/2024

    Notes: Right now we have two distinct systems for handling pages and columns. We should instead have everything managed in the column state since the app experience is effectively the same as having one column, but in different visual states.

    Conclusion: This ended up being a bug in the TRPC/React Query library that was being caused by onMutate
    not being called on the first render. I am not sure why onMutate does not fire until the call
    is actually made, but we just need to handle the state locally in the ColumnRow component
    instead and it is fixed. Still, if it errors out it will revert back to what it was before.
