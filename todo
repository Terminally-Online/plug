Do These:
    ✔ Sticky header @chance @done(24-06-27 13:48)
    ☐ On logged in homepage, when user has no plugs, show 2 curated Plugs and CTA to create a Plug @@chance @started(24-06-27 11:55)
        ☐ Include curated plugs in the homepage
        ✔ Create a plug call to action @done(24-06-27 11:55)
    ✔ Schedule component @chance @started(24-06-30 11:28) @done(24-07-01 17:53) @lasted(1d6h25m19s)
        ✔ Date picker component @chance @done(24-07-01 16:19)
        ✘ Timezone component @drake @cancelled(24-07-01 17:53)
        ✔ Recurring component @drake @done(24-07-01 17:53)
            ✘ Create the design for this. @cancelled(24-07-01 17:53)
            Notes: The only idea I have up to this point is to have a temporary frame that opens up with all the options
               and a search bar that allows you to filter down through the options. We do not want to use the default
               browser dropdown because they look like ass and we do not want to use popovers in general because
               it is exceptionally bad UX to have elements that cover other information. Unlike a normal app, 
               we cannot just push it to the side because the input is full width (ie: frames) so it would be weird
               regardless of where it is placed.
        ✘ Time component @cancelled(24-07-01 17:53)
            Notes: Don't know what this should realistically look like. I have departed from what we had in the Figma because
               it was a bit reductive in functionality and showing the calendar only once you click into a time component
               results in the frame being super wobbly as components are hidden and shown.
    ☐ Input validation @chance
    ☐ ETH balances when selecting a chain to execute on @chance
    ☐ Share images for Plugs
    ✘ Store static assets in a CDN cause we have way too many static files and they are going to eat an insane amount of bandwidth @cancelled(24-06-27 02:12)
    ☐ Handle 404 and 504 errors for when we retrieve a specific Plug
    ☐ You should not be able to edit the actions in a preview state
    ☐ After forking, do not show it in the templates unless the actions have changed @chance
    ☐ When a plug is deleted that you are viewing that is not yours... @chance
        ☐ Fix the bug where it only shows sometimes.
            Notes: There is some edge case where it is not always showing and I don't know what it is.

    ✔ Do curated plugs update when you search / tag filter or are they persistent?
        ✔ Are they hidden when you search/filter by tag? @done(24-06-27 14:24)
            Notes: You make these decisions. There are code references for you already. You should have all 
                   the technical knowledge needed to make these decisions and update the API/frontend
                   to whatever decision you make.
                ✔ Decision: @done(24-06-27 14:24)
                    In MVP, curated plugs are persistent. 
                    They are not hidden when you search/filter by tag.

Bugs:
    ☐ When you plugs are edited that you do not own they show up on your homepage.
    ☐ Choosing a different secondary value in parent dependent action values does not result in the new value being saved. @chance
        Notes: If you choose a noun accessory, and then choose a new one, the old one is still saved. This is presumably
               due to the "new value" checks that I implemented where we are checking if the parent value is the same,
               and if so, we early return resulting in the new child value not being saved..
    ☐ Need to remove the viewed plugs from the users context plug list after they stop viewing a plug.
    ☐ When you direct access a plug, it errors out when the global context has not yet been loaded
    ✔ Fix type error in actions index @chance @done(24-06-26 17:52)
    ✔ Actions are visible behind action search and run/schedule buttons @chance @done(24-06-24 21:22)
    ✔ Fix scrolling in big frames @chance @done(24-06-24 23:04)
        Notes: A piece of this is because there are multiple frames open at once when there shouldn't be.
        Conclusion: This was the entirety of the issue. Broke them into their own frames with only one
                    active at a time and everything resolved itself.
    ✔ h1 in frame header is causing a hierarchy issue @chance @started(24-06-24 23:14) @done(24-06-24 23:18) @lasted(4m6s
    ✘ When you scroll in a frame the background should not be scrolled with it @chance @cancelled(24-06-26 13:56)
        ✔ Make the scrollbar prettier @chance @started(24-06-24 23:43) @done(24-06-24 23:47) @lasted(4m2s)
            Conclusion: I just hid it because it is 2024 and who the hell cares about scrollbars.
