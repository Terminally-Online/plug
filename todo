Drake Tasks:
    ☐ Rounded square logos
        Source and share w/ chance because image uploads from my side don't work.

    ✔ Integration request functionality @started(24-06-27 14:31) @done(24-06-27 19:32) @lasted(5h1m1s)

    ✔ Do curated plugs update when you search / tag filter or are they persistent?
        ✔ Are they hidden when you search/filter by tag? @done(24-06-27 14:24)
            Notes: You make these decisions. There are code references for you already. You should have all 
                   the technical knowledge needed to make these decisions and update the API/frontend
                   to whatever decision you make.
                ✔ Decision: @done(24-06-27 14:24)
                    In MVP, curated plugs are persistent. 
                    They are not hidden when you search/filter by tag.

Bugs:
    ☐ When you plugs are edited that you do not own they show up on your homepage.
    ☐ Choosing a different secondary value in parent dependent action values does not result in the new value being saved. @chance
        Notes: If you choose a noun accessory, and then choose a new one, the old one is still saved. This is presumably
               due to the "new value" checks that I implemented where we are checking if the parent value is the same,
               and if so, we early return resulting in the new child value not being saved..
    ☐ Need to remove the viewed plugs from the users context plug list after they stop viewing a plug.
    ☐ When you direct access a plug, it errors out when the global context has not yet been loaded
    ✔ Fix type error in actions index @chance @done(24-06-26 17:52)
    ✔ Actions are visible behind action search and run/schedule buttons @chance @done(24-06-24 21:22)
    ✔ Fix scrolling in big frames @chance @done(24-06-24 23:04)
        Notes: A piece of this is because there are multiple frames open at once when there shouldn't be.
        Conclusion: This was the entirety of the issue. Broke them into their own frames with only one
                    active at a time and everything resolved itself.
    ✔ h1 in frame header is causing a hierarchy issue @chance @started(24-06-24 23:14) @done(24-06-24 23:18) @lasted(4m6s
    ✘ When you scroll in a frame the background should not be scrolled with it @chance @cancelled(24-06-26 13:56)
        ✔ Make the scrollbar prettier @chance @started(24-06-24 23:43) @done(24-06-24 23:47) @lasted(4m2s)
            Conclusion: I just hid it because it is 2024 and who the hell cares about scrollbars.
