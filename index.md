# Introduction

<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.6)">Plug enables transaction automation across the Ethereum ecosystem by building on a modern infrastructure stack. Delivered in a simple plug-and-play platform, Plug is designed for users who want the best outcomes even when they are not online or at their device.</span>

## How is Plug Different

The first question most people have is, of course, how is Plug different from everything else out there? Here’s a table to give you a quick summary:

| Features                        | Plug | Pool-Based Automation | Script-Based Automation |
| ------------------------------- | :--: | :-------------------: | :---------------------: |
| 🤖 No-Code                      |  ✅  |          ✅           |           ❌            |

**In short:** Other open platforms are generally old, slow and bloated, while other closed platforms give you absolutely no control over the strategies that you are running and how. Plug provides the best of both worlds, and more.

## Background

Plug was created by a terminally online team led by [Chance](https://twitter.com/nftchance), [Reka](https://twitter.com/reka_eth), and [Drake](https://twitter.com/drakedanner). We understand the experience of using the blockchain deeply and have a vast majority of our assets onchain. The lack of real asset management and use was painfully aware. We missed countless opportunities, we’ve watched many fall for phishing attack vectors as they bounce between different interfaces, we’ve see the impacts of blackswan events that result in thousands of people losing all their money in the blink of an eye. Plug was created to resolve this.

Today, Plug is the only place the general blockchain user can go to add constraints to their transactions. There’s no technical experience needed. There’s no loss of asset custody. It’s an improvement in experience, outcomes, and safety for every single user.

Our goal is always to deliver the absolute best experience possible while giving users outcomes incapable of being routinely achieved when forced to run each transaction manually.

### A Lean Team

Our operating team remains small so that we can focus on a prioritized set of goals and objectives. We do not have team members that are disconnected from the vision we are building. Everyone is working to manifest the same future. You do not have to worry about a broad range of skills for protocol development, for app intentions, for fee modeling; none of it. You get the full attention of every team member every day.

### Transparent by Default

Due to the nature of building on the blockchain, every piece of Plug can constantly be verified with ease. Revenue can be easily calculated with a query of onchain activity, code utilized can be viewed on the respective block explorer for each chain. No cloaks or daggers.

### Sustainable Business

Contrary to the typical crypto protocol, Plug is designed to be self-sustaining so that we can always prioritize giving you, the user, the absolute best experience possible. We feed the flywheel because the business is dependent on it. We win together. When you win, we win.

### Collaborative Building

The experience and functionality delivered by our team is entirely guided by you. You are the critical piece that enables us to build an industry defining product. Because of this, when you create a strategy we have a constant fee share. You are not just a user, you are an owner of the Plug ecosystem and product.

## Features

Plug comes with a powerful set of features built directly into the core framework which can be customized and configured based on the needs of each individual user.

Here's a quick overview of the main features you'll probably be interested in as you're getting started. This isn't an exhaustive list, just some highlights.

### How we make product decisions

Plug is a small team that works to maintain exceptional focus at all times. To keep things running efficiently, we hone in on what users want most and work rapidly to deliver improvements, unlocks, and changes requested. Because the core of our intent is to give you an unrivaled experience there is nothing more important than building what users want.

When deciding what to do next, we try to look at what would benefit most users to the largest scale. Outside of the core team, Plug is completely open source, so anyone in the world can contribute and help build a feature they'd like to see in the software, even if the core team isn't working on it.

### Generalized Intents

Intents are a way to express what you want with granular definition. It's like when you type an address into Google Maps. You don't know the specific route it is going to take you on. All you know is that you want to take the most efficient and shortest route. Until now though, you've grown used to navigating every route without even having a map. You don't have a navigator that's using all the information available. Plug is that navigator for all of the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Multi-Chain Actions

Today when you are running transactions you must deal with countless clicks across countless chains. When using Plug you can execute a series of **onchain** actions across multiple chains through a single click. Now, you can kick-back as transactions are paired together across several different chains without having to deal with the complexity of bridging and the associated delays.

### 24/7 Simulation & Execution

When you declare an intent with Plug our system is constantly working to create a transaction that delivers the outcomes you want within the specification allowed. This means that your strategies can be running at all times. Whether you're at dinner, asleep, or on vacation, your transactions will be executed when your intended outcome can be achieved.

### Scheduled Transactions & Recurring Outcomes

Have a specific period of time you want to execute your transaction? Want a transaction to occur on a regular basis? Use the same scheduling methods you are used to on calendars and gain more control over how you use your favorite primitives.

With Plug, your intent can be reused so that you do not have to come back and sign a new transaction every time you want it to be executed. When a transaction should execute every Friday, it can, with just one click.

### Real Composability

Connect multiple primitives together with ease that have historically been independent pieces. There's no need to bounce between different interfaces. If you want to swap with Uniswap and immediately use it as collateral in Aave, you can automatically have everything executed in one transaction that reverts if any piece of the execution does not result in what you want. You're no longer reliant on primitives or the supporting applications to offer you customized routes.

## Supercharged Blockchain Automation

Before Plug, the choices you had for real onchain automation were effectively non-existent.

- **Before:** If you wanted to enter a Yearn Vault when APY reached 50%, you would have to constantly pull out your phone, log in, connect your wallet, check the rewards, move the proper funds, and enter manually. Finally, once you've done all that you still have to routinely check the rewards and exit when the rates go down.
- **After:** You can set an intent to enter a Yearn Vault when it reaches your target APY. Not only does this free you up to research other strategies or spend time with your family, it also ensures that you enter the vault immediately when it reaches the target APY giving you maximal yield within your constraint.

The benefits of intents paired with general automation leads to unlocks that have seemed impossible for over a decade...

- Manage the health factor of your loan.
- Update your liquidity provided and secure higher returns than anyone else.
- Fulfill order availability the instant it opens.
- Submit your bid in auctions.
- Grid trade assets and capture volatility.
- Liquidiate your stablecoin exposure when it starts to depeg.
- ... and much more.

Plug is a zero-to-one moment where the general user unlocks the capability to handle the complexity, time consuming, and scale-limited transactions you are used to dealing with.

## Who is Plug for?

Plug is focused on two different sets of users:

- **Prosumers:** Knowledgable of the ways that onchain primitives can be used independently and together to enable sophisticated strategies to achieve outcomes better than enabled through a standard application.
- **Consumers:** Has onchain assets, but has historically not had a way to effectively use them due to the existing levels of complexity, required knowledge, and unavoidable need for high level development skills.

Every day, Plug powers some of the most valuable transactions executed throughout the entire Ethereum ecosystem all without asking users to learn a new skill or invest significant amounts of time.
