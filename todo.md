> Hello, you have stumbled upon my working todo for Emporium. It lives in the documentation here because I bounce

> project is not setup in a way that enables simple contributions. That is intentional for now. Focusing on what matters

TODO: 
- [ ] Get the raw client implementation functional with raw trpc connections.
- [ ] Make sure that we can encode and decode each enforcer.

- [ ] Think about the relayer implementation as this is what really has my interest.

- [ ] Update `authority` nomenclature to just use `permission` for increased conistency.
- [ ] Figure out what to do about branding/naming.

PENDING:
- [ ] Finish the documentation.

BUGS:
- [ ]

WANTS:
- [ ] Package up the trpc connector into the sdk to offer a more explicit integration path.
    Notes: This is where the `process.env.API_URL` and managed functions would be exposed.
- [ ] Ability to declare a set of allowed cavets and domains.
    Notes: This is effectively `localization` for an api and its contained data.

RELEASING:
- [ ]

DONE:
- [ ]
