# If This, Then That (IFTTT)

The concept of "If This, Then That" is straightforward but holds immense potential. It's the core logic that allows you to build complex conditional statements, which is especially powerful in smart contracts and blockchain technologies.

## What is an IFTTT statement?

At its essence, "If This, Then That" is a conditional statement that enables automation. You set a trigger (`This`), and if that trigger occurs, a particular action (`That`) follows.

-   If the trigger is met, then the action happens.
-   If condition `A` is true, then perform action `B`.

This logic isn't just a fancy way of saying something. It's a powerful concept used [extensively in programming, data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model), and now increasingly in blockchain technology.

You might be thinking, "Hey, this sounds a lot like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), [Apple Shortcuts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) and all those [IFTTT (If This, Then That) services](https://ifttt.com/) I use to automate my life!" Well, you're right; the underlying logic is quite similar. Services like Zapier or IFTTT let you create "Zaps" or "Applets" that link different apps and services together based on triggers and actions.

## How does `Emporium` use IFTTT?

In `Emporium`, you're doing something similar but in a much more powerful and secure environmentâ€”the blockchain. Here, the "_If This, Then That_" logic enables you to create complex conditions and actions related to smart contracts. Instead of linking social media accounts or automating email notifications, you're setting rules for how digital assets and data can be accessed, moved, or transformed.

Imagine automating an entire financial system, a voting mechanism, or an ownership registry with the same ease you set a reminder to water your plants. That's the potential power of employing IFTTT logic in the blockchain via `Emporium`.

By understanding the simple yet powerful logic of "If This, Then That," you're not just becoming proficient in using `Emporium`; you're understanding a foundational principle of modern technology.

To sum it up in the simplest way, `Emporium` is like [Zapier](https://zapier.com), but for EVM smart contracts.
