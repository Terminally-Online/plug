					<p>Dear anon,</p>
					<p>
						Every turn of the market cycle we find ourselves
						spending more time online. Yet, we go to sleep and miss
						the opportunity we had been trying to time for weeks.
					</p>
					<p>
						You were not born to watch numbers go up and down. You
						were not born to obsess over the smallest details of
						blockchain transactions. You were not born to live like
						a robot in a world of abundance.
					</p>
					<p>
						Plug is designed to give you your life back. To give you
						the reality we all dream of where your money works even
						when you donâ€™t. To let you unlock the fully power of
						onchain financial primitives and the composability
						between the many options.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can choose to stay in the past and get worse
						execution with unexpected outcomes or you can use Plug
						and always be certain the outcomes will be generated
						when your conditions have been met.
					</p>
					<p>Love,</p>
