These are the transactions that most people are familiar with in the blockchain world, like sending or receiving cryptocurrency. They are straightforward but rigid, performing a single action as soon as they&#39;re confirmed by the network. You can&#39;t change them or add conditions to them once they&#39;re sent. They&#39;re your straightforward, no-nonsense way to interact with a blockchain.</p><p>Now, take a second to think about how many times you have pressed that <code>Send</code> button only to scream out &#39;<strong>NoOoOoO!!!</strong>&#39; a few seconds later. That&#39;s the state of typical blockchain user experience even when it&#39;s just $5 dollars.</p><h2 id="characteristics-of-imperative-transactions" tabindex="-1">Characteristics of Imperative Transactions <a class="header-anchor" href="#characteristics-of-imperative-transactions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Characteristics of Imperative Transactions&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="immediacy" tabindex="-1">Immediacy <a class="header-anchor" href="#immediacy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Immediacy&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The first thing to know about imperative transactions is that they happen quickly. Once the network confirms your transaction, it&#39;s done. The blockchain updates, and that&#39;s it. This quick action is useful for straightforward tasks like transferring money, but it means you can&#39;t take it back. Mistakes are permanent, so you need to be careful.</p><h3 id="determinism" tabindex="-1">Determinism <a class="header-anchor" href="#determinism" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Determinism&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Determinism in this context means that the result of your transaction is predictable. If you&#39;re sending someone 10 coins, you know that once the transaction goes through:</p><ul><li>They&#39;ll have 10 more coins,</li><li>and you&#39;ll have 10 less.</li></ul><p>This is good for everyone; it keeps things transparent and easy to understand. However, it also means that these types of transactions lack flexibility. What you see is what you get.</p><h3 id="fees-and-gas" tabindex="-1">Fees and Gas <a class="header-anchor" href="#fees-and-gas" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fees and Gas&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Sending transactions isn&#39;t free; you have to pay for the computing power that makes it happen. These fees vary depending on the blockchain you&#39;re using and how busy it is. The fees serve two purposes.</p><ul><li>First, they discourage spam transactions that could clog the network.</li><li>Second, they incentivize the people running the network to include your transaction.</li></ul><p>So, you&#39;ll want to set your fees carefully.</p><h2 id="examples-of-imperative-transactions" tabindex="-1">Examples of Imperative Transactions <a class="header-anchor" href="#examples-of-imperative-transactions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Examples of Imperative Transactions&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="value-transfer" tabindex="-1">Value Transfer <a class="header-anchor" href="#value-transfer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Value Transfer&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The most basic transaction is just sending money from one person to another. It&#39;s straightforward, immediate, and irreversible. Whether you&#39;re sending funds to a friend or paying for goods and services, value transfers are the simplest form of blockchain transactions.</p><h3 id="minting-tokens" tabindex="-1">Minting Tokens <a class="header-anchor" href="#minting-tokens" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Minting Tokens&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When you mint new tokens in a blockchain like Ethereum, you&#39;re executing an imperative transaction. You call a function on a smart contract to create a specific number of tokens. Once minted, these tokens exist and are usually sent to a particular address.</p><h3 id="voting-in-a-dao" tabindex="-1">Voting in a DAO <a class="header-anchor" href="#voting-in-a-dao" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Voting in a DAO&quot;">​</a></h3><p>DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) often require members to vote on proposals. Casting your vote is an imperative transaction. Once you vote &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no&#39; on a proposal, your vote is recorded on the blockchain, and you can&#39;t change it later.</p><h3 id="changing-ownership-of-a-digital-asset" tabindex="-1">Changing Ownership of a Digital Asset <a class="header-anchor" href="#changing-ownership-of-a-digital-asset" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Changing Ownership of a Digital Asset&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When you sell or transfer a digital asset like an NFT (Non-Fungible Token), you&#39;re executing an imperative transaction. You update the owner field in the smart contract, transferring ownership rights to the new owner. Like all imperative transactions, this is irreversible.</p><h3 id="creating-a-smart-contract" tabindex="-1">Creating a Smart Contract <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-smart-contract" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creating a Smart Contract&quot;">​</a></h3><p>When you deploy a new smart contract to a blockchain, that&#39;s an imperative transaction. The code is sent in a transaction, and once confirmed, the smart contract exists on the blockchain at a specific address.</p><h2 id="why-imperative-transactions-are-vital" tabindex="-1">Why Imperative Transactions are Vital <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-imperative-transactions-are-vital" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why Imperative Transactions are Vital&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Imperative transactions are like the bread and butter of blockchain. They&#39;re the simplest, most direct way to make something happen. They&#39;re the starting point for anyone new to blockchain and will likely remain the most commonly used form of transaction for at least the next few years. However, they aren&#39;t perfect. They lack the flexibility and conditional logic that other, more advanced types of transactions offer. That&#39;s where things like <a href="/intents/introduction.html">Intents</a> come in, adding layers of complexity and options on top of these basic transactions.</p>',28),r=[o];function s(c,h,l,d,m,p){return a(),t("div",null,r)}const g=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
