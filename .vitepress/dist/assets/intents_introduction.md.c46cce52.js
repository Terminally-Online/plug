Unlike your typical blockchain <code>Transaction</code> that is <a href="/intents/imperative-transactions.html">imperative</a>, <code>Intents</code> operate as <a href="/intents/declarative-messages.html">declarative messages</a> that carry a more complex set of instructions and conditions.</p><p>To explain it in the simplest way possible, <code>Intents</code> are like a set of instructions that tell the blockchain what to do and all the conditions that must be met to be valid. They can be used to automate a wide range of actions, from simple swaps to complex multi-step operations.</p><p><strong>A <a href="/intents/imperative-transactions.html">traditional transaction</a> says:</strong></p><ul><li>Swap token <code>A</code> for token <code>B</code>.</li></ul><p><strong>Intents is a <a href="/intents/declarative-messages.html">declarative message</a> that says:</strong></p><ul><li>If the diversity of my 401k is imbalanced, then swap token <code>A</code> for token <code>B</code>, up to the amount required to rebalance my portfolio, without exceeding my daily spending limit.</li></ul><p>Hopefully this slightly exaggerated example helps to illustrate the power of <code>Intents</code> and how they can be used to automate a wide range of actions on the blockchain.</p><h2 id="transaction-template-types" tabindex="-1">Transaction Template Types <a class="header-anchor" href="#transaction-template-types" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Transaction Template Types&quot;">​</a></h2><p><code>Intents</code> can be thought of as <code>Transaction</code> templates that hold not only the operation to be executed but also any associated conditions, permissions, and metadata. They provide a structured way to interact with smart contracts and onchain state in general.</p><p>With extra information provided, <code>Intents</code> are codified versions of &quot;if this, then that&quot; statements that can be used to automate a wide range of actions on the blockchain. As long as the conditions can be verified as valid, the intent can be executed.</p><h3 id="implicit-intents" tabindex="-1">Implicit Intents <a class="header-anchor" href="#implicit-intents" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Implicit Intents&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Implicit intents are those that are inferred from a user&#39;s actions but are not explicitly stated.</p><p>For example, when a user interacts with a decentralized application to swap tokens, the implied intent might swap to a more desired asset. These are often simpler in structure and more straightforward to implement because they are linked to specific user-triggered events.</p><ul><li>Suitable for simple transactions or operations.</li><li>Tied to user-specific events or actions.</li><li>Cannot handle complex conditions or multi-step operations well.</li></ul><h3 id="explicit-intents" tabindex="-1">Explicit Intents <a class="header-anchor" href="#explicit-intents" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Explicit Intents&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Explicit intents are those that are clearly specified either by the user or a system. For instance, a smart contract could be programmed to release funds when certain conditions are met, like the lapse of a specific time period or the accomplishment of a milestone.</p><ul><li>Ideal for multi-step operations that require specific conditions to be met.</li><li>Can be created by users or automatically by smart contracts.</li><li>Capable of handling complex logic and inter-contract interactions.</li></ul><h3 id="bounded-intents" tabindex="-1">Bounded Intents <a class="header-anchor" href="#bounded-intents" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bounded Intents&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Bounded intents have a specific time-frame or other limiting conditions. For instance, an auction smart contract could include a bounded intent that only allows bidding until a certain date and time.</p><ul><li>Often associated with deadlines or temporal constraints.</li><li>Execution depends on external factors or internal states.</li><li>Usually serves specific, singular purposes.</li></ul><h3 id="unbounded-intents" tabindex="-1">Unbounded Intents <a class="header-anchor" href="#unbounded-intents" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Unbounded Intents&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Unbounded intents are those without any specific limitations or conditions. They are open-ended and could theoretically be executed at any time, assuming they are otherwise valid.</p><ul><li>No time constraints or conditional limitations.</li><li>Suitable for a wide range of applications and uses.</li><li>Can be executed at any time.</li></ul><h2 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summary&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain and smart contracts, understanding the concept and types of <code>Intents</code> can be a game-changer. From the simplicity of <a href="#implicit-intents">Implicit Intents</a> to the complex logic embedded in <a href="#explicit-intents">Explicit Intents</a>, the categorization provides a structured way to handle various use-cases with varying degrees of complexity. <a href="#bounded-intents">Bounded</a> and <a href="#unbounded-intents">Unbounded</a> <code>Intents</code> further expand the scope, allowing for conditional and time-sensitive operations as well as open-ended possibilities.</p><p>As blockchain systems continue to become more complex and interconnected, the role of <code>Intents</code> as flexible and powerful tools for action execution will likely become even more critical. Whether you&#39;re a developer building the next decentralized application or a user looking to interact with on-chain operations, a deep understanding of <code>Intents</code> can offer valuable insights into how to make your actions more effective, reliable, and secure.</p>',27),s=[o];function r(c,l,d,p,h,u){return t(),n("div",null,s)}const b=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
