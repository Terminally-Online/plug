# Execution Paths

## [Single Lane Nonces](/intents/execution-paths/single-lane)

Nonces are a key component of every EVM blockchain and are extended in `Emporium` to provide a powerful and flexible permissioning system. With the core focus of preventing replay attacks, nonces ensure that each signed reference is only seen once.

## [Multi-Dimensional Nonces](/intents/execution-paths/multi-dimensional)

Extending the concept of [Single Lane Nonces](/intents/execution-paths/single-lane), Multi-Dimensional Nonces allow for the creation of a permission stack that enable multiple parallel queues of intent declaration and transaction execution that do not interfere with one another. Nonce-level categorization.
