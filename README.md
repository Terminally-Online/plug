# ðŸ”Œ Plug App

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a submodule of the larger [Plug monorepo](https://github.com/nftchance/plug) that contains all the required pieces to run the entire Plug stack yourself.

The application of Plug powers the front-end user interface that enables the capability of building complex declarative EVM transactions (intents) in a trustless node-based editor.

The key functionality is powered by the following packages (each have their own function):

```ml
services
â”œâ”€ authentication â€” "NextAuth & SIWE"
â”œâ”€ client â€” "TRPC"
â”œâ”€ database â€” "Docker & PostgreSQL & Prisma"
â”œâ”€ ethereum â€” "Viem & Wagmi & WalletConnect"
â”œâ”€ server â€” "API backend that powers the server, client interface and sdk when needed."
â”œâ”€ style â€” "Tailwind"
â””â”€ web â€” "Next"
```

## Dependencies

In order to run `@nftchance/plug-app` it is necessary to install all of the following dependencies first:

```ml
â”œâ”€ docker â€” "Pipeline to run containerized code processes."
â””â”€ pnpm â€” "Efficient package manager for Node modules."
```

## Getting Started

To run an instance of `@nftchance/plug-app` is incredibly straightforward. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

> [!TIP]
> You will need a PostgreSQL database running in order to read and save the data of your application.
>
> By default, the app will try running a database through Docker. If it fails however, the build will proceed.
>
> For local development, spin one up using your preferred method, such as Docker. Again, an attempt is made automatically.
>
> For production development, it cannot be on the edge due to the use of Prisma.
