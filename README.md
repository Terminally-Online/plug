`@terminally-online/plug` is a generalized intent framework and platform that brings the capability of automated transactions to all Ethereum based chains.

With state and outcome assurance users can:

-   schedule their transactions and desired outcomes
-   step away from their device
-   and relax as everything is magically executed according to their specification

It's the first all-in-one solution for managing your onchain activity while unlocking the true power of composability and automation.
