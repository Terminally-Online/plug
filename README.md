`@nftchance/plug` is a generalized intent framework that brings the capability of automated transactions powered by outcome assurance across all Ethereum based chains. With state and outcome assurance users can schedule their transactions and desired outcomes, step away from their device, and relax as everything is magically executed according to their specification.

📚 **Previous solutions:**

-   ❌ Users have to stay glued to their device or risk missing opportunities.
-   ❌ Code updates and liquidity migration needed for protocols to support intents.
-   ❌ Running backend architecture required by protocols to enable users.
-   ❌ Transactions executed that result in something unexpected.
-   ❌ Switch to new wallets and sign one transaction at a time.

🔌 **Plug:**

-   ✅ Automatically execute transactions when all conditions have been met.
-   ✅ Instantly supports all contracts deployed past, present and future.
-   ✅ Schedule multiple transactions across multiple chains with one offchain signature.
-   ✅ Trustless sale of intent-enabled accounts.
