# 🔌 Plug

`@nftchance/plug` is a generalized intent framework that brings the capability of automated transactions powered by outcome assurance across all Ethereum based chains.

With state and outcome assurance at both ends of transaction execution users can schedule their transactions and step away from their device without worrying about missing an opportunity. Now, the digital portfolios of everyone can be managed through an open network of `Solvers`.

📚 **Previous solutions:**

-   ❌ Users have to stay glued to their device or risk missing opportunities.
-   ❌ Code updates and liquidity migration needed for protocols to support intents.
-   ❌ Running backend architecture required by protocols to enable users.
-   ❌ Transactions executed that result in something unexpected.
-   ❌ Switch to new wallets and sign one transaction at a time.
