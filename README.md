# 🔌 Plug

`@nftchance/plug` is a generalized intent framework that brings the capability of automated transactions powered by outcome assurance across all Ethereum based chains.

With state and outcome assurance at both ends of transaction execution users can schedule their transactions and step away from their device without worrying about missing an opportunity. Now, the digital portfolios of everyone can be managed through an open network of `Solvers`.

📚 Previous solutions:

-   ❌ Users have to stay glued to their device or risk missing opportunities.
-   ❌ Code updates and liquidity migration needed for protocols to support intents.
-   ❌ Running backend architecture required by protocols to enable users.
-   ❌ Transactions executed that result in something unexpected.
-   ❌ Gas cost consumed before users even know the outcome of their transaction.

🔌 Plug:

-   ✅ Automatically execute transactions when all conditions have been met.
-   ✅ Instantly supports all contracts deployed past, present and future.
-   ✅ Schedule multiple transactions across multiple chains with one offchain signature.
-   ✅ Trustless sale of intent-enabled accounts.
-   ✅ Unlock the capability of systems at scale and reactivity with a single click.

> You are viewing the monorepo of [Plug](https://onplug.io) which is the home of all the packages that power the platform. However, you will notice that an attempt to access a nested repository will result in the inability to access and view it.

> While open-source development has been a pillar of my previous endeavours in this industry, this project is not available to developers in such an easily accessible manner. Although the framework is built in an open-source nature, the code is not available for forking or external use at this time for personal or business projects. Competition is valuable. I challenge you to create your own framework that rivals the capabilities that Plug offers.
>
> Forking is not an option at this time and I hope you can understand that. Concerns of user safety are not valid at this time as everything is done to ensure that no trust is required. At the time of any potentially dangerous actions transparency and clarity is offered. Plug at the deepest layer is a model to provide the capabilities and benefits of developers to end-users and general consumers.
