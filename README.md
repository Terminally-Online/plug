# 🏪 Emporium

This repository contains the key mechanisms to build a modern intent-based framework and protocol. Contained, there are several pieces that you may choose to consume and implement in your own app.

Every existing implementation has been written in an extensible nature enabling the ability to build on top of a foundation that has already been battle-tested without having to worry about re-inventing the wheel.
