Emporium is a modern framework enabling support for counterfactual revokable permissions to most effectively reach economic alignment in transaction execution.

Without `emporium-core`:

-   ðŸš¨ Build your protocol around `Ethereum private key` access.
-   ðŸ¤” The executor of an onchain transaction must pay the `gas`.
-   ðŸ¤¬ Actions must happen sequentially (one after another).

With `emporium-core`:

-   ðŸ§© Enable delegated execution just by inheriting `Framework`.
-   ðŸ¥¹ Achieve complete alignment with full control over the economics of your protocol.
-   âœ… Unlock a distributed network of parallel transactions for Ethereum.
-   ðŸš€ And so much more.
