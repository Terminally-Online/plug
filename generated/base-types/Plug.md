# Plug

A [Plug](/generated/base-types/Plug) data type provides EIP-712 compatability for encoding and decoding the data needed for an `Plug` to be securely distributed and executed. 

::: info
                
Inside the declaration of a `Plug` data type there are nested [Current](/generated/base-types/Current) and [Fuse](/generated/base-types/Fuse) data types that need to be built independently.
                    
:::

## The Data Type

To interact with the data type onchain will you need both the `Typescript` and `EIP-712` representations of the `Plug` data type: 

::: code-group

``` typescript [Typescript/Javascript]
{
    current: Current,
	fuses: Array<Fuse> 
}
```

```typescript [EIP-712]
{
    { name: 'current', type: 'Current' },
	{ name: 'fuses', type: 'Fuse[]' } 
}
```

:::

::: tip

The `Typescript` representation is used to build and work with the object in your dApp and API while the `EIP-712` representation is used to encode and decode the data type onchain.

:::

## Onchain Implementation

With `current` and `fuses` as the fields of the `Plug` data type we can generate the type hash as follows:

::: code-group

```solidity [Verbose.sol]
bytes32 constant PLUG_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "Plug(",
		"Current current",
		"Fuse[] fuses",
        ")"
    )
);
```

```solidity [Inline.sol]
bytes32 constant PLUG_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    'Plug(Current current,Fuse[] fuses)Current(address target,uint256 value,bytes data)Fuse(address target,bytes data)'
);
```

```solidity [Hash.sol]
bytes32 constant PLUG_TYPEHASH = 0x92e7d74a30e1e523d60bcb5fbb30caa2f5fa9f5fbc4a5499c4e9b8b44b7640fd
```
