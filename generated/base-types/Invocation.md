# Invocation

A [Invocation](/generated/base-types/Invocation) data type provides EIP-712 compatability for encoding and decoding the data needed for an `Intent` to be securely distributed and executed. 

::: info
                
Inside the declaration of a `Invocation` data type there are nested [Transaction](/generated/base-types/Transaction) and [SignedDelegation](/generated/base-types/SignedDelegation) data types that need to be built independently.
                    
:::

## The Data Type

To interact with the data type onchain will you need both the `Typescript` and `EIP-712` representations of the `Invocation` data type: 

::: code-group

``` typescript [Typescript/Javascript]
{
    transaction: Transaction,
	authority: Array<SignedDelegation> 
}
```

```typescript [EIP-712]
{
    { name: 'transaction', type: 'Transaction' },
	{ name: 'authority', type: 'SignedDelegation[]' } 
}
```

:::

::: tip

The `Typescript` representation is used to build and work with the object in your dApp and API while the `EIP-712` representation is used to encode and decode the data type onchain.

:::

## Onchain Implementation

With `transaction` and `authority` as the fields of the `Invocation` data type we can generate the type hash as follows:

::: code-group

```solidity [Verbose.sol]
bytes32 constant INVOCATION_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "Invocation(",
		"Transaction transaction",
		"SignedDelegation[] authority",
        ")"
    )
);
```

```solidity [Inline.sol]
bytes32 constant INVOCATION_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    'Invocation(Transaction transaction,SignedDelegation[] authority)Caveat(address enforcer,bytes terms)Delegation(address delegate,bytes32 authority,Caveat[] caveats,bytes32 salt)SignedDelegation(Delegation delegation,bytes signature)Transaction(address to,uint256 gasLimit,bytes data)'
);
```

```solidity [Hash.sol]
bytes32 constant INVOCATION_TYPEHASH = 0xa0165d57b57f5979da95ed49e640a5eda32f551fff25e41350aeb4719ffb34f0
```
