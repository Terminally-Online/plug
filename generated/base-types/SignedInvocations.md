# SignedInvocations

A [SignedInvocations](/generated/base-types/SignedInvocations) data type provides EIP-712 compatability for encoding and decoding the data needed for an `Intent` to be securely distributed and executed. 

::: info
                
Inside the declaration of a `SignedInvocations` data type there are nested [Invocations](/generated/base-types/Invocations) data types that need to be built independently.
                    
:::

## The Data Type

To interact with the data type onchain will you need both the `Typescript` and `EIP-712` representations of the `SignedInvocations` data type: 

::: code-group

``` typescript [Typescript/Javascript]
{
    invocations: Invocations,
	signature: '0x${string}' 
}
```

```typescript [EIP-712]
{
    { name: 'invocations', type: 'Invocations' },
	{ name: 'signature', type: 'bytes' } 
}
```

:::

::: tip

The `Typescript` representation is used to build and work with the object in your dApp and API while the `EIP-712` representation is used to encode and decode the data type onchain.

:::

## Onchain Implementation

With `invocations` and `signature` as the fields of the `SignedInvocations` data type we can generate the type hash as follows:

::: code-group

```solidity [Verbose.sol]
bytes32 constant SIGNED_INVOCATIONS_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "SignedInvocations(",
		"Invocations invocations",
		"bytes signature",
        ")"
    )
);
```

```solidity [Inline.sol]
bytes32 constant SIGNED_INVOCATIONS_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    'SignedInvocations(Invocations invocations,bytes signature)Caveat(address enforcer,bytes terms)Delegation(address delegate,bytes32 authority,Caveat[] caveats,bytes32 salt)Invocation(Transaction transaction,SignedDelegation[] authority)Invocations(Invocation[] batch,ReplayProtection replayProtection)ReplayProtection(uint256 nonce,uint256 queue)SignedDelegation(Delegation delegation,bytes signature)Transaction(address to,uint256 gasLimit,bytes data)'
);
```

```solidity [Hash.sol]
bytes32 constant SIGNED_INVOCATIONS_TYPEHASH = 0xca44829f32c718effc142faee9c5417e8aa84e7d1d202bdf493c0c1a5e0c3c41
```
