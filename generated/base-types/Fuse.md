# Fuse

A [Fuse](/generated/base-types/Fuse) data type provides EIP-712 compatability for encoding and decoding the data needed for an `Plug` to be securely distributed and executed. 

## The Data Type

To interact with the data type onchain will you need both the `Typescript` and `EIP-712` representations of the `Fuse` data type: 

::: code-group

``` typescript [Typescript/Javascript]
{
    neutral: '0x${string}',
	live: '0x${string}' 
}
```

```typescript [EIP-712]
{
    { name: 'neutral', type: 'address' },
	{ name: 'live', type: 'bytes' } 
}
```

:::

::: tip

The `Typescript` representation is used to build and work with the object in your dApp and API while the `EIP-712` representation is used to encode and decode the data type onchain.

## Onchain Implementation

With `neutral` and `live` as the fields of the `Fuse` data type we can generate the type hash as follows:

::: code-group

```solidity [Verbose.sol]
bytes32 constant FUSE_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "Fuse(",
		"address neutral",
		"bytes live",
        ")"
    )
);
```

```solidity [Inline.sol]
bytes32 constant FUSE_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    'Fuse(address neutral,bytes live)'
);
```

```solidity [Hash.sol]
bytes32 constant FUSE_TYPEHASH = 0x86dfe4f6559e569c29a2c4007b8d0df7d2a58f1f05891f9a9655ceb9105cfae6
```
