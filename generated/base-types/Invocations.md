# Invocations

A [Invocations](/generated/base-types/Invocations) data type provides EIP-712 compatability for encoding and decoding the data needed for an `Intent` to be securely distributed and executed. 

::: info
                
Inside the declaration of a `Invocations` data type there are nested [Invocation](/generated/base-types/Invocation) and [ReplayProtection](/generated/base-types/ReplayProtection) data types that need to be built independently.
                    
:::

## The Data Type

To interact with the data type onchain will you need both the `Typescript` and `EIP-712` representations of the `Invocations` data type: 

::: code-group

``` typescript [Typescript/Javascript]
{
    batch: Array<Invocation>,
	replayProtection: ReplayProtection 
}
```

```typescript [EIP-712]
{
    { name: 'batch', type: 'Invocation[]' },
	{ name: 'replayProtection', type: 'ReplayProtection' } 
}
```

:::

::: tip

The `Typescript` representation is used to build and work with the object in your dApp and API while the `EIP-712` representation is used to encode and decode the data type onchain.

## Onchain Implementation

With `batch` and `replayProtection` as the fields of the `Invocations` data type we can generate the type hash as follows:

::: code-group

```solidity [Verbose.sol]
bytes32 constant INVOCATIONS_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "Invocations(",
		"Invocation[] batch",
		"ReplayProtection replayProtection",
        ")"
    )
);
```

```solidity [Inline.sol]
bytes32 constant INVOCATIONS_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    'Invocations(Invocation[] batch,ReplayProtection replayProtection)Caveat(address enforcer,bytes terms)Delegation(address delegate,bytes32 authority,Caveat[] caveats,bytes32 salt)Invocation(Transaction transaction,SignedDelegation[] authority)ReplayProtection(uint256 nonce,uint256 queue)SignedDelegation(Delegation delegation,bytes signature)Transaction(address to,uint256 gasLimit,bytes data)'
);
```

```solidity [Hash.sol]
bytes32 constant INVOCATIONS_TYPEHASH = 0xffa95fee4c883866684aac5dfdf3c640f7506e536c3535a04db2c8dd491a1331
```
