# Delegation

A [Delegation](/generated/base-types/Delegation) data type provides EIP-712 compatability for encoding and decoding the data needed for an `Intent` to be securely distributed and executed.

::: info

Inside the declaration of a `Delegation` data type there are nested [Caveat](/generated/base-types/Caveat) data types that need to be built independently.

:::

## The Data Type

To interact with the data type onchain will you need both the `Typescript` and `EIP-712` representations of the `Delegation` data type:

::: code-group

```typescript [Typescript/Javascript]
{
    delegate: '0x${string}',
	authority: '0x${string}',
	caveats: Array<Caveat>,
	salt: '0x${string}'
}
```

```typescript [EIP-712]
{
    { name: 'delegate', type: 'address' },
	{ name: 'authority', type: 'bytes32' },
	{ name: 'caveats', type: 'Caveat[]' },
	{ name: 'salt', type: 'bytes32' }
}
```

:::

::: tip

The `Typescript` representation is used to build and work with the object in your dApp and API while the `EIP-712` representation is used to encode and decode the data type onchain.

:::

## Onchain Implementation

With `delegate`, `authority`, `caveats` and `salt` as the fields of the `Delegation` data type we can generate the type hash as follows:

::: code-group

```solidity [Verbose.sol]
bytes32 constant DELEGATION_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "Delegation(",
		"address delegate",
		"bytes32 authority",
		"Caveat[] caveats",
		"bytes32 salt",
        ")"
    )
);
```

```solidity [Inline.sol]
bytes32 constant DELEGATION_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    'Delegation(address delegate,bytes32 authority,Caveat[] caveats,bytes32 salt)Caveat(address enforcer,bytes terms)'
);
```

```solidity [Hash.sol]
bytes32 constant DELEGATION_TYPEHASH = 0x0923dfb5e2bafd4c388ae96884c7ca373d004a9b5aabe8148abc96cc04303777
```
