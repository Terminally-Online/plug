# SignedDelegation

A [SignedDelegation](/generated/base-types/SignedDelegation) data type provides EIP-712 compatability for encoding and decoding the data needed for an `Intent` to be securely distributed and executed.

::: info

Inside the declaration of a `SignedDelegation` data type there are nested [Delegation](/generated/base-types/Delegation) data types that need to be built independently.

:::

## The Data Type

To interact with the data type onchain will you need both the `Typescript` and `EIP-712` representations of the `SignedDelegation` data type:

::: code-group

```typescript [Typescript/Javascript]
{
    delegation: Delegation,
	signature: '0x${string}'
}
```

```typescript [EIP-712]
{
    { name: 'delegation', type: 'Delegation' },
	{ name: 'signature', type: 'bytes' }
}
```

:::

::: tip

The `Typescript` representation is used to build and work with the object in your dApp and API while the `EIP-712` representation is used to encode and decode the data type onchain.

:::

## Onchain Implementation

With `delegation` and `signature` as the fields of the `SignedDelegation` data type we can generate the type hash as follows:

::: code-group

```solidity [Verbose.sol]
bytes32 constant SIGNED_DELEGATION_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "SignedDelegation(",
		"Delegation delegation",
		"bytes signature",
        ")"
    )
);
```

```solidity [Inline.sol]
bytes32 constant SIGNED_DELEGATION_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    'SignedDelegation(Delegation delegation,bytes signature)Caveat(address enforcer,bytes terms)Delegation(address delegate,bytes32 authority,Caveat[] caveats,bytes32 salt)'
);
```

```solidity [Hash.sol]
bytes32 constant SIGNED_DELEGATION_TYPEHASH = 0xe54c7c2b4903b4a68c4f5dd528d6bb9af1f29a813be9a0384794024bb6efa71c
```
