# Pin

A [Pin](/generated/base-types/Pin) data type provides EIP-712 compatability for encoding and decoding the data needed for an `Plug` to be securely distributed and executed. 

::: info
                
Inside the declaration of a `Pin` data type there are nested [Fuse](/generated/base-types/Fuse) data types that need to be built independently.
                    
:::

## The Data Type

To interact with the data type onchain will you need both the `Typescript` and `EIP-712` representations of the `Pin` data type: 

::: code-group

``` typescript [Typescript/Javascript]
{
    neutral: '0x${string}',
	live: '0x${string}',
	fuses: Array<Fuse>,
	salt: '0x${string}' 
}
```

```typescript [EIP-712]
{
    { name: 'neutral', type: 'address' },
	{ name: 'live', type: 'bytes32' },
	{ name: 'fuses', type: 'Fuse[]' },
	{ name: 'salt', type: 'bytes32' } 
}
```

:::

::: tip

The `Typescript` representation is used to build and work with the object in your dApp and API while the `EIP-712` representation is used to encode and decode the data type onchain.

:::

## Onchain Implementation

With `neutral`, `live`, `fuses` and `salt` as the fields of the `Pin` data type we can generate the type hash as follows:

::: code-group

```solidity [Verbose.sol]
bytes32 constant PIN_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "Pin(",
		"address neutral",
		"bytes32 live",
		"Fuse[] fuses",
		"bytes32 salt",
        ")"
    )
);
```

```solidity [Inline.sol]
bytes32 constant PIN_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
    'Pin(address neutral,bytes32 live,Fuse[] fuses,bytes32 salt)Fuse(address neutral,bytes live)'
);
```

```solidity [Hash.sol]
bytes32 constant PIN_TYPEHASH = 0xcce1e9f06fac47a82e9f06488062d578622e3bb04c17dbf4991e33285a127a82
```
