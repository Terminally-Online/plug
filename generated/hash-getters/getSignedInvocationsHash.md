# getSignedInvocationsHash

Encode a [SignedInvocations](/generated/base-types/SignedInvocations) into a hash and verify the decoded [SignedInvocations](/generated/base-types/SignedInvocations) data from a hash to verify type compliance.

## Parameters

- `$input` : [SignedInvocations](/generated/base-types/SignedInvocations) : The `SignedInvocations` data to encode.

## Returns

- `$hash` : `bytes32` : The packet hash of the encoded [SignedInvocations](/generated/base-types/SignedInvocations) data.

## Onchain Implementation

With `getSignedInvocationsHash` you can call the function as a `read` and get the encoded data back as a hash.

This is helpful in times when you need to build a message hash without tracking down all the types as well as when you need to verify a signed message hash containing a `SignedInvocations` data type.

::: code-group

```solidity [Types.sol:getSignedInvocationsHash]
function getSignedInvocationsHash(
	SignedInvocations memory $input
) public pure virtual returns (bytes32 $hash) {
	$hash = keccak256(abi.encode(
		SIGNED_INVOCATIONS_TYPEHASH,
		getInvocationsHash($input.invocations),
		keccak256($input.signature)
	));
}
```
