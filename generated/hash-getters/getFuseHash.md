# getFuseHash

Encode a [Fuse](/generated/base-types/Fuse) into a hash and verify the decoded [Fuse](/generated/base-types/Fuse) data from a hash to verify type compliance.

## Parameters

- `$input` : [Fuse](/generated/base-types/Fuse) : The `Fuse` data to encode.

## Returns

- `$hash` : `bytes32` : The packet hash of the encoded [Fuse](/generated/base-types/Fuse) data.

## Onchain Implementation

With `getFuseHash` you can call the function as a `read` and get the encoded data back as a hash. 
        
This is helpful in times when you need to build a message hash without tracking down all the types as well as when you need to verify a signed message hash containing a `Fuse` data type.

::: code-group

``` solidity [Types.sol:getFuseHash]
function getFuseHash(
	TypesLib.Fuse memory $input
) public pure virtual returns (bytes32 $hash) {
	$hash = keccak256(abi.encode(
		FUSE_TYPEHASH,
		$input.target,
	keccak256($input.data)
	));
}
```
