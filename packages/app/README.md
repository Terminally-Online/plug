# ðŸ”Œ Plug App

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is a submodule of the larger [Plug monorepo](https://github.com/terminally-online/plug) that contains all the required pieces to run the entire Plug stack yourself.

The application of Plug powers the front-end user interface that enables the capability of building complex declarative EVM transactions (intents) in a trustless node-based editor.

The key functionality is powered by the following packages (each have their own function):

```ml
services
â”œâ”€ authentication â€” "NextAuth & SIWE"
â”œâ”€ client â€” "TRPC"
â”œâ”€ database â€” "Docker & PostgreSQL & Prisma"
â”œâ”€ ethereum â€” "Viem & Wagmi & WalletConnect"
â”œâ”€ server â€” "API backend that powers the server, client interface and sdk when needed."
â”œâ”€ style â€” "Tailwind"
â””â”€ web â€” "Next"
```

## Dependencies

In order to run `@terminally-online/plug-app` it is necessary to install all of the following dependencies first:

```ml
â”œâ”€ docker â€” "Pipeline to run containerized code processes."
â””â”€ pnpm â€” "Efficient package manager for Node modules."
```

## Getting Started

### Preparing the Environment

Built into this repository is a simple script that enables the encryptoion and descryption of the `.env` file.

You do not need to keep track of several different keys and passwords when it is handled. When a push is made to the repository, `.env.encrypted` is automatically generated and you will pull down any updates with the latest commit/PR. When you run the client or server, the env will be decrypted and placed in `.env`.

For this to work, you will need to have a `.env` file in the root of your repository with the single value like:

```bash
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<THE_TEAM_ENCRYPTION_KEY>
```

Whoever is in charge of the encryption key will be able to provide it to you. Once you've set the value, your environment is ready.

### Running the App

To run an instance of `@terminally-online/plug-app` all you have to do is open your terminal and run:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
