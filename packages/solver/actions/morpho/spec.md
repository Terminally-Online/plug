## Contract Interfacing

For each vault specified and returned by the API call we have a `asset` field that reflects the asset that can be borrowed. This asset however does not reflect which tokens can be used as collateral.

To determine which vaults we support you can make the call to their API with the following query:

```graphql
query ExampleQuery($first: Int) {
  vaults(first: $first, where: { chainId_in: [1], whitelisted: true }) {
    items {
      address
      symbol
      name
      whitelisted
      metadata {
        image
      }
      asset {
        address
        decimals
        name
        symbol
        logoURI
      }
      state {
        apy
        netApy
        allocation {
          enabled
          market {
            collateralAsset {
              address
              name
              symbol
              logoURI
              decimals
            }
          }
        }

}
```

### Earn via Morpho Vault

deposit() is called on the Morpho Vault.

Mints shares Vault shares to receiver by depositing exactly amount of underlying tokens.

- MUST emit the Deposit event.
- MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the deposit execution, and are accounted for during deposit.
- MUST revert if all of assets cannot be deposited (due to deposit limit being reached, slippage, the user not approving enough underlying tokens to the Vault contract, etc).

NOTE: most implementations will require pre-approval of the Vault with the Vaultâ€™s underlying asset token.

"Deposit {0 amount} {1 token} to {1->2 vault}."

### Withdraw from Morpho Vault

This is called on the Morpho Vault.

Burns shares from owner and sends exactly assets of underlying tokens to receiver.

- MUST emit the Withdraw event.
- MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the withdraw execution, and are accounted for during withdraw.
- MUST revert if all of assets cannot be withdrawn (due to withdrawal limit being reached, slippage, the owner not having enough shares, etc).

NOTE: some implementations will require pre-requesting to the Vault before a withdrawal may be performed. Those methods should be performed separately.

"Withdraw {0 amount} {1 token} from {1->2 vault}."

### Withdraw Max from Morpho Vault

This is called on the Morpho Vault by using Redeem.

Burns exactly shares from owner and sends assets of underlying tokens to receiver. - MUST emit the Withdraw event.

- MAY support an additional flow in which the underlying tokens are owned by the Vault contract before the redeem execution, and are accounted for during redeem.
- MUST revert if all of shares cannot be redeemed (due to withdrawal limit being reached, slippage, the owner not having enough shares, etc).

NOTE: some implementations will require pre-requesting to the Vault before a withdrawal may be performed. Those methods should be performed separately.

maxRedeem() read on vault can be used to find this amount.

"Withdraw all {0 token} from {0->1 vault}."

## Markets

### Supply Collateral

"Supply {0 amount} {1 collateral} as collateral for {1->2 token}."

### Withdraw Collateral

"Withdraw {0 amount} tokens from {1 market}."

### Withdraw All Collateral

"Withdraw all collateral from {0 market}."

### Borrow from Morpho Market

Borrows `assets` or `shares` on behalf of `onBehalf` and sends the assets to `receiver`.

Either `assets` or `shares` should be zero. Most use cases should rely on `assets` as an input so the caller is guaranteed to borrow `assets` of tokens, but the possibility to mint a specific amount of shares is given for full compatibility and precision.`msg.sender` must be authorized to manage `onBehalf`'s positions.

Borrowing a large amount can revert for overflow.

Borrowing an amount of shares may lead to borrow fewer assets than expected due to slippage. Consider using the `assets` parameter to avoid this.

"Borrow {0 amount} {1 token} against {2 collateral_amount} {2->3 collateral}."

### Repay

"Repay {0 amount} tokens in {1 market}."

### Repay in Full

"Repay entire position in {1 market}."

### Claim Rewards

"Claim rewards"

### LTV

"LTV for position in {0 market} is {1 operator} than {2 threshold}."

### Get APY

"{0 action} APY in {1->2 vault/market} is {3 operator} than {4 threshold}."
