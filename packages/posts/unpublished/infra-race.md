## The Infra Race

- Success in markets viewed through information and execution speed
- Information: quality, speed, and processing ability
- Execution speed: faster movers capture more alpha
- The missing third component: Transaction Infrastructure
- Example from traditional finance: ISDA in The Big Short
- In crypto, many layers of transaction sophistication exist

## Levels of Transacting

When we transact onchain, we're competing with other users for block space.
Our ability to capture alpha is limited by our transaction capabilities.

### Tier 1: Centralized Exchange Users
- Trade on CEXs like Coinbase/Binance
- Use basic market/limit orders
- Abstracted from onchain mechanics
- Front-run by exchanges themselves

### Tier 2: Self-Custody Beginners
- Off-ramp to self-custody wallets (Ledger, Rainbow)
- Use wallet's built-in swap features
- Pay convenience fees unknowingly
- No direct protocol interaction

### Tier 3: Simple Protocol Users
- Interact directly with protocols:
  - Uniswap for swaps
  - Opensea for NFTs
- Higher fees than aggregators
- Limited to single-protocol actions

### Tier 4: Advanced Protocol Users
- Compare rates across lending markets
- Use aggregators for better pricing
- Basic understanding of gas optimization
- Beginning awareness of transaction inefficiencies

### Tier 5: Weapons-Grade Protocol Users
- Understand Ethereum's "Dark Forest" mempool
- Use private RPCs to avoid MEV attacks
- Leverage Flashbots for priority transactions
- Set up Telegram bots for trading opportunities
- Treat transacting as a competitive sport

### Tier 6: Custom Infrastructure Creators
- Build proprietary execution systems
- Create monitoring for data feeds
- Develop specialized transaction bundling
- Automate cross-protocol strategies
- Deploy capital programmatically

## The Infrastructure Gap

- Most DeFi users stuck in Tiers 1-4
- Massive leap from Tier 4 to Tier 5
- Even bigger jump to Tier 6
- Custom infrastructure is prohibitively expensive:
  - Requires deep protocol knowledge
  - Sophisticated development resources
  - Private infrastructure
  - Constant maintenance
  - Significant time investment
- Creates uneven playing field

## Democratizing Transaction Sophistication

- Plug provides Tier 6 infrastructure without engineering requirements
- Features include:
  - Constraint-driven execution
  - Cross-protocol composition
  - MEV protection
  - Scheduled strategies
  - Transparent transaction mechanics

## The Future Belongs to the Infrastructure-Native

- Gap will widen between those with sophisticated infrastructure and those without
- Information advantage becoming less significant
- Transaction infrastructure becoming the durable competitive edge
