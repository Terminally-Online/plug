## The Dead End Problem

- Every degen's first story: "I bought some NFTs... now what?"
- The tab hell of trying to do anything meaningful
- Why most users get stuck at basic swaps and never evolve
- The gap between "I want to do something cool" and actually doing it
- The friction between imagination and execution

## The Strategy Gap

### Knowledge Barriers

- Understanding protocol capabilities and limitations
- Learning optimal execution paths
- Building contextual awareness ("is this even a good idea?")
- Assessing risks across complex operations

### Current Power User Reality

- Telegram alpha groups and information gathering
- Multiple DEX tabs and manual coordination
- Spreadsheets and personal tracking systems
- Building individual systems to manage complexity
- The cost of being your own integration layer
- The reality of needing your own transaction execution infrastructure in crypto

## Chat Interfaces for Guided User Journeys

- Why everyone's obsessed with chat interfaces (and why they're mostly wrong)
- The real value proposition of conversational UI
- Learning what's possible vs. executing what's necessary
- When chat interfaces help and when they hurt
- Moving beyond "do this for me" to "show me how"

## Terminal Velocity: The Evolution of Power Users

### The Progressive Journey

- Moving from basic operations to complex strategies
- Building muscle memory for protocol composition
- When and how to remove the training wheels
- The transition from guided to autonomous execution

### The Terminal State

- What it means to be truly "terminally online"
- Command centers vs. chat interfaces for serious users
- The importance of precise control and visibility
- Building for power users who never log off
- Why composition needs to become second nature

## Key Themes to Weave Throughout

- The balance between automation and control
- Why knowledge accumulation matters more than interface simplification
- The difference between trading convenience for capability
- How serious users actually want to interact with DeFi
- The role of tools in user evolution

## Supporting Examples to Include

- Real user progression stories
- Common strategy execution failures
- Successful power user workflows
- Where current tools fall short
- How command centers enable mastery

Key narrative arcs we could develop:

The Journey Story

Start with the relatable "I just bought some NFTs" moment
Show how users naturally want to do more complex things
Highlight the frustration of having ideas but lacking tools
Reveal how proper tools unlock natural progression

The Infrastructure Reality

Why personal infrastructure (spreadsheets, multiple tabs, etc.) exists
How this DIY approach holds users back
Why chat interfaces alone don't solve this
How real infrastructure (like Plug) changes the game

The Power User Evolution

How users naturally progress when given proper tools
Why command centers beat chat interfaces for serious users
How Plug's approach enables rather than limits
Real examples of what becomes possible

We could structure this around a "day in the life" of different user stages:

The beginner juggling basic tools
The intermediate user building personal systems
The power user with proper infrastructure

Users start with simple DeFi interactions but often hit a wall. They can imagine complex strategies but can't execute them. While everyone else is trying to 'simplify' DeFi with chat interfaces, we see a different path: Building the infrastructure and tools that let users grow from basic swaps to sophisticated strategy execution. Chat can help guide that journey, but the end state isn't talking to a bot - it's having a professional-grade command center that gives you true control.
