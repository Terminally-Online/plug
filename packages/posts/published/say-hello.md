We are Terminally Online.

You may know us individually as danner, drake, or chance. You may even consider yourself Terminally Online yourself. 

We've spent the past 5 years plugged into the EVM landscape and we're here to plug you in too.

## The Current State of Things

If you're reading this, you probably have a setup that looks familiar: Multiple monitors, endless Discord notifications, and more browser windows than your RAM signed up for. The state of DeFi feels like trying to play 4D chess while juggling. You've got your yield farms here, your LP positions there, and god forbid you try to time a swap across multiple protocols without missing the perfect entry.

We've been there. We are there. And we're building the solution we've always wanted.

## The Reality Check

Initially, when we set out to build Plug, we considered building a product that allowed users to log off and spend more time touching grass. As we continued to build, we realized - that's not who we are. We live in the ether, we spend our days streaming our homes to those we build with. We named our company Terminally Online for a reason...

Let's be real - I've got 47 browser tabs open right now, three different DEX aggregators running, and I'm probably farming yield in my sleep. This isn't a problem to solve - it's who we are. The question isn't how to log off, it's how to become terminal. 

## The Journey Here

I've spent my entire life seeking the cutting edge of functional technology and my entire career in early stage fintech and crypto startups. I've had the opportunity to build teams and hire across every department imaginable. I've gotten to perform a laundry list of operational and technical roles and the teams I've worked with have built systems that have processed $5b+ across compliant Web2 and Web3 rails. I've gotten to work with Chance over the years as he's enabled nearly a million gas optimized transactions and developed delightful software experiences.

We're excited to begin releasing product that we fully own and direct.

## Enter Plug

We're not here to tell you to touch grass. We're here to build the command center for the terminally online. Your protocols, your strategies, your automations - all running exactly how you want them, when you want them. No more tab juggling required.

For the first time ever, you can:
- Schedule constraints-driven transactions (because sometimes you need to sleep)
- Access all major protocol functionality without bouncing between apps
- Create and share strategies that actually make you money
- Set up "if this, then that" executions that squeeze maximum value from every move

One interface to access Etherem, one interface to combine protocols, one interface to schedule transactions, and one interface to manage your onchain experience.

## What's Coming

We're starting with Season 0 - our founding users phase. This initial release will be referral-gated, with priority access for everyone on the Plug waitlist. Being a founding user means more than just early access; it comes with built-in advantages that persist:

Your transactions will be evaluated more frequently, leading to better execution. We'll subsidize your gas costs on L2s, and you'll get early access to new features as we roll them out.

We're taking a seasonal approach to give us flexibility - each season lasting between one to several months. This structure lets us integrate new protocols, test incentive alignment mechanisms, and evolve the product ecosystem based on what we learn together.

When we transition to Season 1, our founding users keep their enhanced capabilities. We're building Plug for the long term, and we want our earliest users to remain at the forefront of its evolution.

## The Future

This isn't just another DeFi tool. We're building the infrastructure for the next generation of onchain activity. A platform where users can compose, automate, and execute complex strategies without compromising on control or capability. This is about unlocking the true potential of being terminally online.
