# Fees

Everywhere you go when using the blockchain you have to obsess over the fees that you are going to pay as a user and/or builder. Let me keep it simple. At this time there are no fees at any piece of the Plug stack.

- There is no application fee.
- We will pay the gas fee to execute your transactions onchain.
- Swaps do not take 1 cent.
- When possible we disable the fees of external protocols.

All of this is certain to change in the future. Everything is setup to empower you with the highest velocity blockchain experience without having to think about a single one of the typical complexities.
