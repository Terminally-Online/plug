# Overview

Plug enables transaction automation using a generalized intents framework that empowers users to plug-and-play with premier onchain protocols. Establish constraints, declare desired outcomes, and schedule execution. Plug’s generalized Solvers simulate transactions and execute when your outcome is achievable.

## Plugs

Constraints and actions are assembled in a familiar workflow builder interface giving users maximal flexibility over how their onchain assets are handled. Once a set of constraints and actions are established, users can choose to execute right away, schedule for the future, or establish a recurring execution.

Plugs empower end users to execute transactions that have historically only been available to developers.

## Constraints

Choose from a set of constraints that set guardrails for your transaction. Plug is continuously adding new integrations and expanding the set of constraints available. Execute based on price, APY, balance, etc.

Constraints can be layered and give users extreme control over the conditions upon which they want to execute.

## Actions

Establish desired outcomes with integrated protocol actions. Swap, lend, borrow, bid, etc. Plug enables users to declare the outcomes they are seeking. Traditional blockchain interactions are now supercharged with assurance in outcome. Transactions only execute when the outcomes declared can be achieved.

## Scheduling

Utilize a familiar scheduling interface to establish windows where execution should be allowed or to set up a recurring transaction. Users no longer need to be glued to their devices to execute their transactions. Plug’ Solvers respect constraints, outcomes, and schedules to determine when to execute, empowering humans to be human.
