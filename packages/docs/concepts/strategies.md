# Strategies

<span style="color: rgba(0,0,0,0.6)">When you combine [constraints](/concepts/constraints) and [actions](/concepts/actions), you have a strategy. Strategies are intents that can be used to execute transactions across multiple protocols and blockchains in one go.</span>

## Discovering a Strategy

**Importantly, you do not need to be an expert to use Plug.**

With our dual-sided marketplace you have the ability to utilize strategies that have been curated by our team of experts as well as the community. There's no need to start from scratch on everything.

Instead, you can learn the ins-and-outs of the Plug framework by exploring strategies that have already been created for you. Realistically, there exist many strategies that every person should be running. If you want to dig deeper and create your own strategy, you can start by looking at the strategies that have already been created and run by others.

## Creating a Strategy

When you have an opinion about the type of intents you'd like to use, getting started is extremely simple with [our plug-and-play platform](https://onplug.io). All of [our integrations](/introduction/integrations) can be browsed, dug into, and assembled with one another to create a strategy that meets your precise needs and preferences. All you have to do is:

1. Declare the limits placed on the execution of your intent from the predefined options.
2. Choose from the list of actions enabled by [the primitives integrated](/introduction/integrations) into Plug with no technical skill required and no code to write.

In just a few seconds, you've created a strategy that has embedded conditions of execution and defined a series of final results that you expect on each successful execution.

With your strategy prepared, the final step is to run it or schedule it for future execution. When you schedule your intent it is immediately broadcasted to the Solver network so that it can start working on finding the best route to the deliver the outcomes you've defined within the constraints you have set.

## Executing a Strategy

- **Immediate Execution:** In some cases, you may want to execute a strategy immediately since it is a one-off transaction and does not have constraints that currently block it from being executed.
- **Scheduled Execution:** In most cases though, you will want to schedule the execution of your strategy so that it can be executed at a later time once the constraints are met and the Solver network has found a route that will deliver the outcomes you've defined.

## No Upfront Payments

Beyond being able to declare better transactions in the form of intents, one of the most helpful things about the architecture in place is that you don't have to pay anything upfront. Instead, you can submit your intent to the Solver network and only pay when your intent is executed successfully.

## Creator Fees

As a user of the [Plug platform](https://onplug.io), you are able to share the strategies you've created. Every time someone else uses your intent, you receive a percent of the fees generated when a transaction based on the intent is successfully executed.

With Plug, you have the power to monetize the Plugs you make accessible to the users of our ecosystem. It's a marketplace that never closes and has instant payouts. Unlike your traditional marketplace, you're selling your knowledge, not your assets or services.
