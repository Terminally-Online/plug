> Hello, you have stumbled upon my working todo for Plug. It lives in the documentation here because I bounce
> from problem to problem without a real scope defined for the territory it resides within. I acknowledge this
> project is not setup in a way that enables simple contributions. That is intentional for now. Focusing on what matters
> and that is not a nicer README. That said, below you can see my todo, active notes and things as they were completed.
